# Chapter 10: Nodes and Edges

Nodes and edges are the fundamental building blocks of Object-Spatial Programming. Nodes represent data locations in your graph, while edges represent the relationships between them. This chapter shows you how to create, connect, and work with these spatial constructs using a simple classroom management system.

!!! topic "Graph-Based Data Modeling"
    Instead of storing data in isolated objects, OSP organizes data as connected nodes in a graph. This makes relationships explicit and enables powerful traversal patterns.

## Node Creation and Properties

!!! topic "What are Nodes?"
    Nodes are special objects that can be connected to other nodes through edges. They automatically persist when connected to the root node and can react to visiting walkers.

### Basic Node Declaration

### Node Persistence with Root

!!! topic "The Root Node"
    Nodes connected to `root` (directly or indirectly) automatically persist between program runs. This gives you a database-like behavior without setup.

            has grade_level: int;
            has student_id: str;
        }

        node Classroom {

## Edge Types and Relationships

!!! topic "First-Class Relationships"
    Edges in Jac are not just connections - they're full objects with their own properties and behaviors. This makes relationships as important as the data they connect.

## Best Practices for Nodes and Edges

!!! summary "Design Guidelines"
    - **Nodes for Entities**: Use nodes for things that exist independently (students, teachers, classrooms)
    - **Edges for Relationships**: Use edges for connections between entities (enrollment, teaching, friendship)
    - **Rich Edge Properties**: Store relationship-specific data in edges (grades, dates, status)
    - **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for node and edge types
    - **Connect to Root**: Always connect important nodes to root for persistence

## Key Takeaways

!!! summary "Chapter Summary"
    - **Nodes** are spatial objects that can be connected and persisted automatically
    - **Edges** are first-class relationships with their own properties and behaviors
    - **Root Connection** provides automatic persistence for connected nodes
    - **Navigation Syntax** makes finding related data intuitive with `[-->]` and `[<--]`
    - **Filtering** enables powerful queries directly in the traversal syntax
    - **Walkers** can traverse and analyze the graph structure effectively

Nodes and edges form the foundation of Object-Spatial Programming. By modeling your data as connected entities rather than isolated objects, you create more natural representations that enable powerful traversal and analysis patterns.

In the next chapter, we'll explore walkers and abilities - the mobile computational entities that bring your graphs to life by moving through and processing your spatial data structures.
