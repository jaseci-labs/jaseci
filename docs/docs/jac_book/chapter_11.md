# Chapter 11: Walkers and Abilities

Walkers are the heart of Object-Spatial Programming - they are mobile computational entities that traverse your graph and execute code at each location. Combined with abilities, they enable reactive, event-driven programming where computation happens exactly where and when it's needed.

!!! topic "Mobile Computation"
    Unlike traditional functions that operate on data passed to them, walkers travel to where data lives, making computation truly spatial and enabling powerful distributed processing patterns.

## Walker Creation

!!! topic "What are Walkers?"
    Walkers are special objects that can move through your graph, carrying state and executing abilities when they encounter different types of nodes and edges.

### Basic Walker Declaration

!!! example "Simple Walker"
    === "Jac"
        <div class="code-block">
        ```jac
        # Simple walker for visiting nodes
        walker MessageDelivery {
            has message: str;
            has delivery_count: int = 0;
            has visited_locations: list[str] = [];

            # Regular methods work like normal
            def get_status() -> str {
                return f"Delivered {self.delivery_count} messages to {len(self.visited_locations)} locations";
            }
        }

        # Basic classroom nodes
        node Student {
            has name: str;
            has messages: list[str] = [];
        }

        node Teacher {
            has name: str;
            has subject: str;
        }

        with entry {
            # Create walker instance (but don't activate it yet)
            messenger = MessageDelivery(message="Hello from the principal!");

            # Check initial state
            print(f"Initial status: {messenger.get_status()}");
        }
        ```
        </div>
    === "Python"
        ```python
        class MessageDelivery:
            def __init__(self, message: str):
                self.message = message
                self.delivery_count = 0
                self.visited_locations = []

            def get_status(self) -> str:
                return f"Delivered {self.delivery_count} messages to {len(self.visited_locations)} locations"

        class Student:
            def __init__(self, name: str):
                self.name = name
                self.messages = []

        class Teacher:
            def __init__(self, name: str, subject: str):
                self.name = name
                self.subject = subject

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            # Create messenger instance
            messenger = MessageDelivery(message="Hello from the principal!")

            # Check initial state
            print(f"Initial status: {messenger.get_status()}")
        ```

## Ability Definitions and Triggers

!!! topic "Event-Driven Execution"
    Abilities are methods that execute automatically when certain events occur during graph traversal. They create reactive, context-aware behavior.

### Entry and Exit Abilities

            # Check Alice's messages
            print(f"Alice's messages: {alice[0].messages}");
        }
        ```

## Walker Spawn and Visit

!!! topic "Graph Traversal"
    Walkers move through graphs using `spawn` (to start) and `visit` (to continue to connected nodes). This enables complex traversal patterns with simple syntax.

    Walkers can control their movement through the graph using special statements like `visit`, `disengage`, and `skip`.

## Key Concepts Summary

!!! summary "Walker and Ability Fundamentals"
    - **Walkers** are mobile computational entities that traverse graphs
    - **Abilities** are event-driven methods that execute automatically during traversal
    - **Entry abilities** trigger when a walker arrives at a node
    - **Exit abilities** trigger when a walker leaves a node
    - **Spawn** activates a walker at a specific starting location
    - **Visit** moves a walker to connected nodes
    - **Disengage** stops a walker's execution

## Best Practices

!!! summary "Walker Design Guidelines"
    - **Keep abilities focused**: Each ability should have a single, clear purpose
    - **Use descriptive names**: Make it clear what each walker and ability does
    - **Handle edge cases**: Check for empty connections before visiting
    - **Control traversal flow**: Use conditions to avoid infinite loops
    - **Report results**: Use exit abilities to summarize walker activities

## Key Takeaways

!!! summary "Chapter Summary"
    - **Walkers** bring computation to data through graph traversal
    - **Abilities** create reactive, event-driven behavior at each graph location
    - **Entry/Exit patterns** provide fine-grained control over processing
    - **Spawn and Visit** enable flexible navigation through connected data
    - **Control flow** statements like `disengage` allow smart traversal decisions

Walkers and abilities transform static data structures into dynamic, reactive systems. They enable algorithms that naturally adapt to the shape and content of your data, creating programs that are both intuitive and powerful.

In the next chapter, we'll explore advanced object-spatial operations including complex traversal patterns and sophisticated filtering techniques that unlock the full potential of graph-based programming.
