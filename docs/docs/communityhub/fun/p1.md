## Project Idea: Rebuilding Aider with Jac and Agentic Object-Spatial Programming

This project proposes rebuilding Aider, the AI pair programming tool, using Jac, leveraging its object-spatial programming paradigm and the MTLLM (`by <llm>`) feature.

### Core Concepts

#### Aider's Functionality

Aider assists developers by:

1.  **Understanding Code Structure:** Analyzing the existing codebase to build a mental model.
2.  **Responding to Prompts:** Taking user requests (e.g., "add a new feature," "fix this bug," "refactor this code").
3.  **Generating Code Changes:** Producing code snippets or entire file modifications.
4.  **Applying Changes:** Integrating the generated code into the existing codebase.
5.  **Iterative Refinement:** Allowing users to review, accept, or reject changes, and provide further instructions.

#### Jac's Object-Spatial Programming

In Jac, a codebase can be represented as a graph.

*   **Nodes:** Represent files, classes, functions, variables, comments, and other code constructs. Each node can have properties (e.g., file path, function signature, variable type, code content).
*   **Edges:** Represent relationships between these constructs (e.g., a function `calls` another function, a class `contains` a method, a file `imports` another file, a variable is `defined in` a function).
*   **Walkers:** Can traverse this code graph to understand its structure, identify relevant sections for a given prompt, and even apply modifications.

#### Jac's MTLLM (`by <llm>`)

The `by <llm>` feature allows Jac to delegate complex reasoning and generation tasks to Large Language Models.

*   **Natural Language Understanding:** An LLM can interpret user prompts for Aider.
*   **Code Generation:** An LLM can generate code snippets based on the prompt and the context derived from the code graph.
*   **Decision Making:** An LLM can decide which parts of the code graph are most relevant to a user's request.

### Proposed Architecture

1.  **Codebase Ingestion and Graph Building:**
    *   A walker traverses the target project directory.
    *   It creates nodes for each file and its constituent elements (classes, functions, imports, etc.).
    *   Edges are established to represent relationships (containment, calls, inheritance, dependencies).
    *   The code content of functions, classes, etc., can be stored as a property of the respective nodes. This process effectively creates a rich, queryable representation of the codebase.

2.  **User Prompt Handling:**
    *   The user's prompt (e.g., "add a login feature to the `User` class") is received.
    *   An MTLLM-powered ability, say `interpret_prompt_and_locate_context(prompt: str) -> list[Node] by <llm>()`, is used.
        *   This ability would leverage the LLM's understanding to identify which nodes (files, classes, functions) in the code graph are most relevant to the prompt.
        *   The LLM could be guided by providing it with schemas of the node types and their properties.

3.  **Information Retrieval and Contextualization (RAG-like):**
    *   Once relevant nodes are identified, their code content and the content of closely related nodes (e.g., functions called by a relevant function, or the class a relevant method belongs to) are retrieved.
    *   This information, along with the user's prompt, forms the context for the code generation step. This is analogous to the retrieval part of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

4.  **Code Generation and Modification Planning:**
    *   Another MTLLM-powered ability, `generate_code_changes(prompt: str, context: str) -> CodeEditPlan by <llm>()`, would take the user prompt and the retrieved context.
    *   `CodeEditPlan` could be a custom Jac object representing the proposed changes (e.g., new code to insert, existing code to modify/delete, target file and line numbers).
    *   The LLM generates the new code and a plan for how to integrate it. For example:
        ```jac
        obj CodeEdit {
            has file_path: str;
            has start_line: int;
            has end_line: int; // Can be same as start_line for insertions
            has new_content: str; // Empty if deleting
            has operation: str; // "insert", "replace", "delete"
        }

        obj CodeEditPlan {
            has edits: list[CodeEdit];
            has reasoning: str; // LLM's explanation for the changes
        }

        can \'Analyze user prompt and relevant code context to generate code modifications.\'
        generate_code_changes(prompt: str, current_code_snippets: dict[str, str]) -> CodeEditPlan by <llm>;
        ```

5.  **Applying Changes:**
    *   A walker receives the `CodeEditPlan`.
    *   It navigates to the target nodes (files) in the code graph.
    *   It applies the specified modifications to the `code_content` property of the relevant file nodes or directly to the source files.

6.  **Iteration and Refinement:**
    *   The user reviews the changes.
    *   If further modifications are needed, the process repeats, with the updated code graph and the new prompt.

### Advantages of this Approach

*   **Deep Code Understanding:** The object-spatial graph provides a structured and queryable representation of the codebase, far richer than simple text parsing. Walkers can perform complex queries and analyses on this graph.
*   **Intelligent Contextualization:** By traversing the graph, the system can gather highly relevant context for the LLM, improving the quality of generated code.
*   **Flexible and Extensible:** New types of code analysis or modification walkers can be easily added. Different LLMs can be swapped in using the `by <llm>` syntax.
*   **Natural Language Interaction:** MTLLM simplifies the interface between the user's natural language requests and the structured code operations.
*   **Jac's Strengths:** Type safety, Pythonic syntax, and the ability to mix imperative, object-oriented, and object-spatial paradigms make Jac a powerful tool for this kind of complex application.

### Project Steps

1.  **Define Core Jac Archetypes:**
    *   `FileNode`, `ClassNode`, `FunctionNode`, `ImportNode`, `VariableNode`, etc.
    *   `CallsEdge`, `ContainsEdge`, `ImportsEdge`, `DefinesEdge`, etc.
    *   `CodeParsingWalker` to build the initial graph from a directory.
2.  **Develop Prompt Interpretation Ability:**
    *   `interpret_prompt_and_locate_context` ability using MTLLM.
3.  **Implement Context Retrieval Walkers:**
    *   Walkers that, given a starting node, can gather relevant surrounding code (e.g., all methods in a class, all functions called by a given function).
4.  **Develop Code Generation Ability:**
    *   `generate_code_changes` ability using MTLLM to produce a `CodeEditPlan`.
5.  **Implement Code Application Walker:**
    *   A walker that takes a `CodeEditPlan` and applies it to the files.
6.  **Build CLI/Interface:**
    *   A way for the user to specify the target project and interact with the Jac-Aider.
7.  **Testing and Refinement:**
    *   Test with various coding tasks and refine the prompts, walkers, and MTLLM abilities.

This project would not only be a powerful demonstration of Jac's capabilities but also a valuable tool for the Jac community and potentially beyond. It pushes the boundaries of how AI can be integrated into the development lifecycle through a deeply code-aware, graph-based approach.
