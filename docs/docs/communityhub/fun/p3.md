## Project Idea: Fine-tuning TinyLLaMA for Enhanced Jac MTLLM Performance

This project focuses on fine-tuning the TinyLLaMA model to significantly improve its ability to handle Jac's MTLLM `by <llm>` calls. The primary goal is to enhance its proficiency in accurately processing structured inputs (like Jac objects passed as context) and generating well-formed, type-consistent structured outputs (such as Jac object instances or other typed data) directly at `by <llm>` call sites.

### Problem Statement

While MTLLM provides a powerful bridge to integrate Large Language Models within Jac programs, smaller, more accessible models like TinyLLaMA might not natively excel at:

*   **Interpreting Complex Jac Structures:** Difficulty in understanding the schema and content of custom Jac objects or complex data structures provided as context (e.g., via `incl_info`) to `by <llm>` calls.
*   **Strict Adherence to Output Typing:** Challenges in consistently generating outputs that strictly conform to Jac's precise type hints (e.g., `list[MyObject]`, `dict[str, int]`) or custom object definitions (e.g., ensuring all required fields of a `obj MyData` are present and correctly typed in the generated output).
*   **Nuanced Understanding of Semstrings:** Suboptimal interpretation of semantic strings (semstrings) when they are intended to guide the generation of specifically structured data rather than free-form text.

### Proposed Solution & Jac's Role

The core of this project is to create a specialized fine-tuning dataset and a robust evaluation process for TinyLLaMA, leveraging Jac's capabilities:

1.  **Dataset Generation using Jac:**
    *   **Corpus Creation:** Assemble a diverse corpus of Jac code examples that utilize the `by <llm>` feature. This should include:
        *   Various input data types passed as context: primitive types, lists, dictionaries, and instances of custom Jac objects.
        *   A wide range of output type hints: simple types (`str`, `int`), collections (`list[str]`), and complex custom Jac objects (e.g., `obj Result { has status: bool; has data: dict; }`).
        *   Examples demonstrating the use of `incl_info` for contextual data passing.
        *   Scenarios where semstrings are used to guide the LLM in generating structured output.
    *   **Automated Input/Output Pair Extraction:**
        *   Develop Jac walkers and scripts to parse the Jac code corpus.
        *   These tools would identify `by <llm>` call sites and automatically extract or help formulate the (prompt, ideal_completion) pairs for fine-tuning.
        *   The "prompt" would encapsulate the function/ability signature, relevant context (including serialized Jac objects), and semstrings.
        *   The "ideal_completion" would be the string representation of the perfectly structured and typed Jac output (e.g., a valid Jac object instantiation string `MyData(field1='value', field2=123)`).

2.  **Fine-tuning TinyLLaMA:**
    *   Employ standard LLM fine-tuning libraries and techniques (e.g., Hugging Face `transformers`, PEFT/LoRA) with the specialized dataset generated in the previous step.
    *   The objective is to train TinyLLaMA to recognize the patterns of Jac MTLLM calls and learn to generate outputs that are syntactically and semantically valid within the Jac ecosystem.

3.  **Evaluation Framework in Jac:**
    *   Construct a Jac-based evaluation harness.
    *   This harness will consist of Jac programs that invoke the fine-tuned TinyLLaMA via `by <fine_tuned_tiny_llm>`.
    *   The harness will programmatically:
        *   Call abilities that use the fine-tuned model.
        *   Receive the (potentially structured) output.
        *   Validate the output against expected Jac types and structures using Jac's runtime type checking and object introspection capabilities.
        *   Measure accuracy in terms of structural integrity, type correctness, and semantic plausibility.

4.  **Integration as an MTLLM Backend:**
    *   Adapt the fine-tuned TinyLLaMA model to be seamlessly integrated as a custom backend within the `jac-mtllm` plugin system, likely by creating a new class inheriting from `BaseLLM`.

### Benefits

*   **Accessible and Local MTLLM:** Empowers developers to use MTLLM features with a small, efficient model that can run locally, reducing dependency on large, cloud-based LLMs.
*   **Improved Reliability for Small Models:** Significantly enhances the reliability and predictability of MTLLM when used with smaller models by making them more adept at Jac's structured data paradigms.
*   **Cost-Effective AI Solutions:** Lowers or eliminates API costs for many GenAI tasks that can be effectively handled by a fine-tuned local model.
*   **Enhanced Privacy:** Facilitates on-device processing for applications dealing with sensitive code or data.
*   **Community Enablement:** Provides the Jac community with a powerful, optimized small model for local MTLLM experimentation and development.

### High-Level Project Steps

1.  **Setup & Tooling:** Prepare the development environment for Jac programming and LLM fine-tuning (Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face libraries, etc.).
2.  **Dataset Design and Scoping:** Define the scope and variety of Jac `by <llm>` patterns, data structures (input/output), and specific tasks to be included in the fine-tuning dataset.
3.  **Jac-Powered Dataset Generation:**
    *   Implement Jac walkers/scripts to automatically or semi-automatically generate fine-tuning data (prompt-completion pairs) from the Jac code corpus.
4.  **TinyLLaMA Fine-Tuning Execution:**
    *   Select a suitable pre-trained TinyLLaMA variant.
    *   Conduct the fine-tuning process using the generated dataset, experimenting with different strategies (e.g., full fine-tuning vs. parameter-efficient methods like LoRA).
5.  **Jac Evaluation Harness Implementation:**
    *   Develop Jac archetypes and test suites to programmatically assess the fine-tuned model's performance on structured data generation tasks.
6.  **MTLLM Backend Integration:** Package the fine-tuned model as an easily usable backend for `jac-mtllm`.
7.  **Testing, Iteration, and Documentation:**
    *   Thoroughly test the integrated fine-tuned model across diverse scenarios.
    *   Iteratively refine the dataset and fine-tuning process based on evaluation results.
    *   Provide clear documentation on how to set up and use the fine-tuned TinyLLaMA with Jac MTLLM.

This project would be a significant contribution to the Jac ecosystem, making its advanced AI-integration features more accessible, efficient, and reliable, especially for developers preferring or requiring local model execution.
