# <span style="color: orange"> Generative AI in Jaclang - MTP

Integration of AI models as core software components is becoming mainstraeam. Jac-lang facilitates the integration of such models, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) into programming in an ultra seamless manner. We name this functionality as <span style="color:orange;">MTP</span>, meaning "Meaning-typed Programming". There is an extensive research journey which you can dive into, available on arxiv.org. (Link available at the bottom of this page)

The MTP concept is realized in Jac-lang as the **MTLLM** plugin which can be installed as a PyPi package.
