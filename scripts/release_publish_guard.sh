#!/usr/bin/env bash
# A release becomes "latest" only once it carries every binary it is required
# to carry, and it publishes without the ones it is not.
#
# Usage: release_publish_guard.sh <version> <required-platform>...
#
#   every required asset attached -> flip the draft to published
#   a required asset missing      -> refuse; the draft stays a draft
#   a platform not on the list    -> ignored; the release publishes without it
#
# The platform list comes from build-binaries.yml's `plan` job, which derives it
# from the same array the build matrix comes from. That is the point: `publish`
# used to restate the list inline, under a comment asking whoever edited one
# copy to remember the other. A leg that stops being required in the matrix
# would still have been demanded here, and the release would have hung on an
# asset nothing was building any more.
#
# Refusing matters as much as publishing. install.sh resolves whatever
# /releases/latest points at, so revealing a draft that is missing a binary
# hands that platform's users a release they cannot install from.
#
# RELEASE_ASSET_TIMEOUT / RELEASE_ASSET_POLL tune the poll that absorbs the
# few-second lag between an upload and the assets API reporting it.
