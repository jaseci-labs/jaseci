"""The object-spatial surface the jac0 seed tier lowers to.

jac0 rewrites `node`/`edge`/`walker` declarations, `+>:T:+>`, `[x ->:T:->]`,
`spawn`, `visit`, `disengage`, `del` and `can f with T entry|exit` into calls
on this module. Every helper reaches the same `JacRuntimeInterface` statics
the full compiler's codegen targets, so a seed module and a full-compiler
module share one kernel and one semantics. The runtime is imported lazily:
the seed tier's own modules (the unitree, the parser) define archetypes at
import time, before the runtime package is importable without cycles.

Seed-tier graphs are transient compiler graphs. A field-less directed edge is
a light edge: an entry in the anchors' per-type adjacency (`out_light` /
`in_light`), no edge object, no kernel row, no context. `refs0` reads that
adjacency directly; only edges that carry fields (or attribute assignment at
connect time) become EdgeAnchors in `edges`.
