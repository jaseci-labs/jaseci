"""Launcher boot seam: the path existing jac binaries import at startup.

A built `jac` binary bakes ``from jaclang.jac0core.cli_boot import
start_cli`` into its boot source, so this import path is a frozen
contract with every launcher already in the field -- it cannot move with
the source tree. The real module lives at ``jaclang.cli.cli_boot``
(#8681); binaries built from this tree onward import that directly (see
``jaclang/dist/payload/assemble.jac``), and this seam exists for launchers
built before the reorg.
