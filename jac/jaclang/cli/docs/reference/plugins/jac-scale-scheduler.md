# Scale Scheduler & Background Jobs

> Part of the [Scale subsystem](jac-scale.md).

The scheduler runs walkers and functions on a timer instead of waiting for an HTTP request. You can declare schedules directly in code (static schedules) or create, change, and remove them at runtime through a REST API (dynamic jobs). Every schedule supports three trigger types: a fixed interval, a cron expression, or a one-shot date.

## Quick Start

Enable the scheduler intent in `jac.toml`:

```toml
[project]
name = "scheduler-demo"
version = "0.1.0"
entry-point = "main.jac"

[scale.scheduler]
enabled = true
```

Decorate a walker or function with `@schedule` in `main.jac`:

```jac
glob tick_log: list = [];

@schedule(trigger=ScheduleTrigger.STATIC, interval=5)
def heartbeat -> None {
    tick_log.append("beat");
    print("heartbeat fired");
}
```

Install the scheduler dependencies (this pulls `apscheduler` into the project's `.jac/venv`), then start the server:

```bash
jac install
jac run --serve main.jac
```

The startup log confirms the subsystem is live and `heartbeat` begins firing every 5 seconds:

```
INFO - Initializing scheduler subsystem
INFO - Base Scheduler started with 1 static task(s)
INFO - APScheduler started (timezone=UTC)
INFO - Scheduler subsystem ready
```

!!! note
    Scheduled tasks run inside the server process. They execute under `jac run --serve`; a plain `jac run` executes your entry point once and exits without firing any schedules.

## The `@schedule` Decorator

`@schedule` works on both walkers and functions. `ScheduleTrigger` and `schedule` are builtins, so no import is needed.

```jac
@schedule(trigger=ScheduleTrigger.STATIC, interval=60)
walker SyncInventory {
    can run with Root entry {
        # runs every 60 seconds
    }
}
```

| Argument | Type | Meaning |
|----------|------|---------|
| `trigger` | `ScheduleTrigger.STATIC` or `ScheduleTrigger.DYNAMIC` | `STATIC` starts running as soon as the server boots. `DYNAMIC` marks the target as schedulable through the `/jobs` REST API. |
| `interval` | `float` | Seconds between runs. |
| `cron` | `str` | 5-field cron expression, evaluated in UTC. |
| `date` | `str` | One-shot fire time. A bare `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"` is read in the **server's local timezone** here, not UTC. Append an offset, `"2026-12-31 09:00:00+00:00"`, to pin it. |

A `STATIC` schedule needs exactly one of `interval`, `cron`, or `date`. A `DYNAMIC` target takes no timing arguments in code; the timing arrives later with each API call.

Scheduled walkers are spawned on a graph root when they fire, so they need an ability with a `Root entry`. Scheduled functions are called with no arguments.

## Static Schedules

Static schedules are part of the code. The server discovers them at startup, registers each one, and keeps firing them until the server stops.

```jac
# Every 5 seconds
@schedule(trigger=ScheduleTrigger.STATIC, interval=5)
def heartbeat -> None {
    print("heartbeat fired");
}

# Every day at 09:00 UTC
@schedule(trigger=ScheduleTrigger.STATIC, cron="0 9 * * *")
walker DailyReport {
    can run with Root entry {
        print("daily report walker fired");
    }
}

# Once, at a specific moment. The offset is explicit because a bare
# timestamp is read in the server's local timezone, not UTC.
@schedule(trigger=ScheduleTrigger.STATIC, date="2026-12-31 09:00:00+00:00")
def year_end_cleanup -> None {
    print("cleanup fired");
}
```

!!! warning
    A static `date` that has already passed by the time the server boots is dropped without an error: the task is simply never registered, and the startup log counts one fewer static task. Since a bare timestamp is read in the server's local timezone, a time meant as UTC can land in the past on a server running east of UTC. Pin the offset to avoid this.

Static tasks run as the system user. Use them for app-wide work such as cache warming, digests, and cleanup, not for per-user logic.

Every server replica registers and fires its own copy of each static task, so when you run more than one replica the task executes once per replica per tick. Keep static work idempotent, or route per-tick work through a dynamic job, which takes a per-fire lease when a database is configured.

## Cron Expressions

Cron schedules use the standard 5-field layout, always interpreted in UTC:

```
┌───────── minute (0-59)
│ ┌─────── hour (0-23)
│ │ ┌───── day of month (1-31)
│ │ │ ┌─── month (1-12)
│ │ │ │ ┌─ day of week (0=Monday ... 6=Sunday)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

Each field accepts `*` (any), `*/n` (every n steps), `a-b` (range), and `a,b,c` (list).

| Expression | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `* * * * *` | Every minute |
| `*/15 * * * *` | Every 15 minutes |
| `0 9 * * *` | Daily at 09:00 UTC |
| `0 3 * * 0` | Every Monday at 03:00 UTC |
| `30 8 1 * *` | The 1st of every month at 08:30 UTC |
| `0 12 * * 0-4` | Weekdays (Mon-Fri) at 12:00 UTC |

!!! warning
    The day-of-week field is numeric and starts at Monday: `0` is Monday and `6` is Sunday. This differs from classic Unix cron, where `0` means Sunday.

## Dynamic Jobs via the REST API

Dynamic jobs let users and admins schedule work at runtime without redeploying. First, mark the walker or function as `DYNAMIC` in code:

```jac
@schedule(trigger=ScheduleTrigger.DYNAMIC)
walker SendDigest {
    can run with Root entry {
        print("digest walker fired");
    }
}

@schedule(trigger=ScheduleTrigger.DYNAMIC)
def cleanup_temp -> None {
    print("cleanup fired");
}
```

The decorator is an allowlist: only `DYNAMIC` targets can be scheduled through the API. Everything else is rejected, so clients can never turn arbitrary code into a background job.

### Get a Token

Every `/jobs` endpoint requires a Bearer token. Register once, then log in:

```bash
# Register
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/user/register \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "identities": [{"type": "email", "value": "ops@example.com"}],
    "credential": {"type": "password", "password": "Secret123!"}
  }'

# Log in and capture the token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/user/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "identity": {"type": "email", "value": "ops@example.com"},
    "credential": {"type": "password", "password": "Secret123!"}
  }' | python3 -c "import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['data']['token'])")
```

### Create a Job

`POST /jobs` takes the target name plus one trigger spec:

```bash
# Run the SendDigest walker every 60 seconds
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"walker_or_function": "SendDigest", "trigger": "interval", "interval": 60}'
```

A successful create returns `201` with the stored job:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "type": "response",
  "data": {
    "job_id": "7e540f18-bde5-48a4-9fa8-f627759f618f",
    "name": "SendDigest",
    "created_by": "35e1541f-3010-4828-8765-4df9139a65c9",
    "is_walker": true,
    "created_at": "2026-07-30T06:55:00.583399+00:00",
    "status": "active",
    "trigger": "interval",
    "interval": 60.0,
    "cron": null,
    "date": null
  },
  "error": null,
  "meta": {"extra": {"http_status": 201}}
}
```

The same endpoint handles cron and one-shot date jobs:

```bash
# Run cleanup_temp every night at 03:00 UTC
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"walker_or_function": "cleanup_temp", "trigger": "cron", "cron": "0 3 * * *"}'

# Fire cleanup_temp once at a specific UTC datetime
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"walker_or_function": "cleanup_temp", "trigger": "date", "date": "2026-12-31 09:00:00"}'
```

Scheduling a target that is not decorated with `@schedule(trigger=ScheduleTrigger.DYNAMIC)` fails with a `400`:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "type": "error",
  "data": null,
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_REQUEST",
    "message": "\"get_log\" does not have a @schedule decorator. Add @schedule(trigger=ScheduleTrigger.DYNAMIC) to enable dynamic scheduling."
  },
  "meta": {"extra": {"http_status": 400}}
}
```

### List, Inspect, Update, Delete

```bash
# List your jobs (admins see all jobs)
curl "http://localhost:8000/jobs?limit=10&offset=0" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Fetch one job by id
curl http://localhost:8000/jobs/7e540f18-bde5-48a4-9fa8-f627759f618f \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Change the schedule: switch the interval job to every 15 minutes via cron
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/jobs/7e540f18-bde5-48a4-9fa8-f627759f618f \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"trigger": "cron", "cron": "*/15 * * * *"}'

# Remove the job
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/jobs/7e540f18-bde5-48a4-9fa8-f627759f618f \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

The list response is paginated and scoped to the caller:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "type": "response",
  "data": {
    "jobs": [ /* job records */ ],
    "count": 2,
    "total": 2,
    "limit": 10,
    "offset": 0
  },
  "error": null,
  "meta": {"extra": {"http_status": 200}}
}
```

`GET /jobs` also accepts `trigger` (filter by `interval`, `cron`, or `date`) and, for admins, `created_by` (filter by user id) as query parameters.

### API Summary

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `POST` | `/jobs` | Create a job for a `DYNAMIC` walker or function |
| `GET` | `/jobs` | List active jobs (paginated, filterable) |
| `GET` | `/jobs/{job_id}` | Fetch one job |
| `PUT` | `/jobs/{job_id}` | Replace the job's trigger spec |
| `DELETE` | `/jobs/{job_id}` | Delete the job |

### Ownership and Execution Identity

- Regular users see and manage only jobs they created. Admins can inspect, update, and delete any job.
- A dynamic walker job runs as the user who created it: the walker is spawned on that user's graph root, so per-user jobs operate on per-user data.
- If the creating user is later deleted, the job stops running and is marked `failed` instead of executing against a missing account.
- Static schedules, by contrast, always run as the system user.

### Error Reference

| HTTP | Code | When |
|------|------|------|
| `400` | `INVALID_REQUEST` | Missing trigger fields, a malformed cron expression, a target without the `@schedule` decorator, or a target that is not `DYNAMIC` |
| `401` | `UNAUTHORIZED` | Missing or invalid `Authorization` header |
| `404` | `NOT_FOUND` | Unknown walker/function name, or job id that does not exist (or belongs to another user) |
| `503` | `STORAGE_UNAVAILABLE` | The database job store is temporarily unreachable |
| `500` | `SCHEDULER_ERROR` | Unexpected internal failure |

!!! note
    A `date` string that does not parse passes request validation and only fails when the job is handed to the scheduling engine, so it currently surfaces as `500 SCHEDULER_ERROR` rather than `400`. Stick to the `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"` format shown above.

## Persistence and Run History

Where jobs live depends on the database connection, set as `url` under `[scale.database]` in `jac.toml` or via the `JAC_DB_URL` environment variable:

- **No reachable database**: jobs are held in memory. Dynamic jobs disappear when the server restarts and exist only on the replica that accepted the `POST`. There is also no duplicate-run protection: a schedule registered on more than one replica fires on every one of them, so this mode is for a single local server, not for multi-replica deployments.
- **Database configured** (provisioned automatically by `--scale` on Kubernetes): jobs are persisted to the document store under the `scheduled_jobs` collection, survive restarts, and are re-registered on boot. A per-fire lease ensures each dynamic job fires on only one replica per tick.

Each execution updates the job record with run bookkeeping, visible via `GET /jobs/{job_id}`:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `run_count` | Total number of completed runs |
| `last_run_at` | UTC timestamp of the most recent run |
| `last_status` | `succeeded` or `failed` |
| `last_error` | Error message from the last failed run, else `null` |

## Configuration Reference

All keys live under `[scale.scheduler]` in `jac.toml`:

```toml
[scale.scheduler]
enabled = true
collection = "scheduled_jobs"
thread_pool_size = 10
misfire_grace_time = 60
shutdown_timeout = 10
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `enabled` | `None` | Install-time capability flag: declares that the project uses the scheduler so `jac install` resolves its dependencies (`apscheduler`). It is not a runtime switch; the server always starts the scheduler subsystem and registers `/jobs` and any static schedules. Static schedules run on the built-in scheduler and need no extra packages; dynamic jobs created through `/jobs` require `apscheduler` |
| `collection` | `"scheduled_jobs"` | Collection name for jobs in the database-backed job store |
| `thread_pool_size` | `10` | Worker threads available for concurrently firing jobs |
| `misfire_grace_time` | `60` | Seconds a late job may still fire after its scheduled time (for example after a restart) before the run is skipped |
| `shutdown_timeout` | `10` | Seconds to wait for in-flight jobs when the server stops |
| `system_user_password` | `"__no_login__"` | Password assigned to the internal `__system__` account that static tasks run as, created on first boot. The default is a sentinel; set a real value if you need to log in as that account |
| `user_exists_ttl` | `30.0` | Seconds the scheduler caches the creator-still-exists check for dynamic jobs before re-querying the user store |

## Behavior Notes

- Cron fields, dynamic job triggers, and stored timestamps are all UTC. The one exception is a bare `date` string on `@schedule`, which is read in the server's local timezone; pin an offset there.
- A job never overlaps itself. If a run is still going when the next fire time arrives, the new run waits (`max_instances=1`).
- Missed fires within `misfire_grace_time` execute once on recovery; older misses are dropped rather than replayed in a burst.
- Keep scheduled work idempotent where possible. Interval and cron jobs will run many times, and a restart near a fire time can produce a make-up run.
