Walrus assignments in Jac provide named expressions using the `:=` operator, enabling variable assignment within expressions. This feature allows for more concise code by combining assignment and expression evaluation in a single operation.

#### Basic Syntax

```jac
# Assign and test in one operation
if (count := len(items)) > 0 {
    print(f"Processing {count} items");
}

# Avoid repeated function calls
if (result := expensive_computation()) > threshold {
    process(result);  # Called only once
}
```

#### Common Use Cases

**Loop optimization:**
```jac
while (line := file.read_line()) is not None {
    process_line(line);
}
```

**List comprehensions:**
```jac
valid_items = [processed for item in items 
               if (processed := transform(item)).is_valid()];
```

#### Object-Spatial Integration

```jac
walker GraphAnalyzer {
    can analyze with entry {
        if (neighbors := [-->]) and len(neighbors) > 2 {
            for node in neighbors {
                if (data := node.get_data()) and data.is_important() {
                    visit node;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Scope and Type Safety

Variables created with walrus assignments:
- Extend beyond the expression scope
- Maintain Jac's type safety through inference
- Follow standard scoping rules within functions

#### Best Practices

1. Use meaningful variable names
2. Avoid overuse in complex expressions
3. Combine with guards for conditional logic
4. Prefer for performance optimization scenarios

Walrus assignments provide efficient code patterns while maintaining readability and type safety in both traditional and object-spatial programming contexts.
