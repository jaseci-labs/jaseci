Atomic expressions in Jac represent the most basic building blocks of expressions - the fundamental units that cannot be broken down further. These include literals, references, collections, and other primary elements that form the foundation of more complex expressions.

**Atomic Expression Types**

Atomic expressions in Jac include:

1. **Named References**: Variable names and identifiers (`a`, `x`, `list1`)
2. **Literals**: Direct values embedded in code
   - String literals: `"abcde...."`, `"aaa"`
   - Boolean literals: `True`, `False`
   - Numeric literals in various bases:
     - Binary: `bin(12)` (though this is a function call)
     - Hexadecimal: `hex(78)` (though this is a function call)
3. **Collections**: 
   - Lists: `[2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Tuples: `(3, 4, 5)`
4. **F-strings**: Template strings with embedded expressions (`f"b{aa}bbcc"`)
5. **Parenthesized Expressions**: Expressions wrapped in parentheses for grouping
6. **Type References**: References to type objects using the backtick operator (`)

**Implementation Blocks**

The code example demonstrates the use of `impl` blocks, which can contain atomic expressions as initialization values. The `impl x` block shows how atomic expressions can be used within implementation contexts.

**Global Variables**

Atomic expressions are commonly used in global variable declarations, as shown with `glob c = (3, 4, 5), list1 = [2, 3, 4, 5]` where tuples and lists serve as atomic collection expressions.

**String Concatenation and F-strings**

Jac supports string concatenation using the `+` operator and f-string interpolation where expressions can be embedded within strings using curly braces (`{}`). The example shows `"aaa" + f"b{aa}bbcc"` combining a regular string with an f-string.

**Enumeration Access**

The example also demonstrates atomic access to enumeration values using dot notation (`x.y.value`), showing how atomic expressions can chain together to access nested properties.

Atomic expressions serve as the fundamental building blocks that combine with operators and control structures to create more complex Jac programs. Understanding these basic elements is essential for writing any Jac code.
