Typed context blocks establish type-annotated scopes that provide compile-time type safety and runtime type assertions within data spatial operations. These blocks enhance the reliability of graph traversal and data processing by ensuring type consistency across topological boundaries.

#### Syntax and Structure

```jac
-> type_expression {
    # type-constrained code block
}
```

The arrow syntax (`->`) introduces a typed context where all operations within the block are subject to the specified type constraints. This provides both documentation and enforcement of expected data types during graph operations.

#### Type Safety in Data Spatial Operations

Typed context blocks ensure type consistency when walkers traverse between nodes with varying data structures:

```jac
walker DataValidator {
    can validate with entry {
        -> dict[str, any] {
            # Ensures node data conforms to expected structure
            node_data = here.data;
            validated = check_required_fields(node_data);
            if (validated) {
                visit here.neighbors;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Return Type Enforcement

When combined with abilities, typed context blocks enforce return type contracts:

```jac
node ProcessingNode {
    can compute_result -> list[float] {
        -> list[float] {
            # Guarantees return type matches declaration
            raw_values = self.get_raw_data();
            processed = [float(v) for v in raw_values];
            return processed;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Integration with Graph Traversal

Typed context blocks work seamlessly with data spatial references and traversal operations:

```jac
walker TypedTraverser {
    can process with entry {
        # Type-safe neighbor access
        -> list[node] {
            neighbors = [-->];
            filtered = neighbors |> filter(|n| n.has_required_data());
            return filtered;
        }
        
        # Continue traversal with type safety
        visit filtered;
    }
}
```

#### Nested Type Contexts

Type contexts can be nested to provide granular type control within complex operations:

```jac
can analyze_graph -> dict[str, list[node]] {
    -> dict[str, list[node]] {
        categories = {};
        
        -> list[node] {
            all_nodes = [-->*];  # Get all reachable nodes
            for node in all_nodes {
                category = node.get_category();
                if (category not in categories) {
                    categories[category] = [];
                }
                categories[category].append(node);
            }
        }
        
        return categories;
    }
}
```

Typed context blocks bridge the dynamic nature of graph traversal with static type guarantees, enabling robust data spatial programs that maintain type safety across topological boundaries while preserving the flexibility of the computation-to-data paradigm.
