Expressions in Jac form the computational backbone of the language, providing a rich hierarchy of operations that combine values, variables, and function calls into meaningful computations. Jac's expression system extends Python's familiar syntax while adding unique features for object-spatial programming and enhanced type safety.

#### Expression Hierarchy

Jac expressions follow a well-defined precedence hierarchy:

1. **Conditional expressions**: Ternary conditional operations
2. **Lambda expressions**: Anonymous function definitions
3. **Concurrent expressions**: Flow and wait operations
4. **Walrus assignments**: Named expressions with `:=`
5. **Pipe expressions**: Forward and backward piping
6. **Bitwise operations**: Bit manipulation operations
7. **Logical operations**: Boolean logic and comparisons
8. **Arithmetic operations**: Mathematical computations
9. **Connect expressions**: Data spatial connections
10. **Atomic expressions**: Basic values and references

#### Basic Expression Types

```jac
42                    # Integer literal
"hello world"        # String literal
user_name            # Variable reference
calculate(x, y)      # Function call
result = value if condition else alternative;  # Conditional expression
```

#### Object-Spatial Expression Integration

Expressions integrate seamlessly with object-spatial constructs:

```jac
walker DataProcessor {
    can analyze with entry {
        neighbors = [-->];
        connected_count = len(neighbors);
        next_node = neighbors[0] if neighbors else None;
        
        if connected_count > threshold {
            visit neighbors.filter(lambda n: Node : n.is_active());
        }
    }
}
```

#### Type-Safe Expression Evaluation

```jac
let count: int = items.length();
let ratio: float = total / count;
let is_valid: bool = (count > 0) and (ratio < 1.0);
```

#### Performance Considerations

- Left-to-right evaluation for same precedence operations
- Short-circuit evaluation for logical operators
- Constant folding for literal expressions
- Type specialization for performance

Expressions provide the foundation for all computational operations in Jac, supporting both traditional programming patterns and object-spatial algorithms while maintaining type safety and performance optimization.
