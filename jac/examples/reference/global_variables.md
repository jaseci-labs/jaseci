Global variables provide module-level data storage that persists throughout program execution and can be accessed across different scopes within a Jac program. Jac offers two declaration keywords with distinct semantic meanings and access control capabilities.

#### Declaration Keywords

**`let` Keyword**: Declares module-level variables with lexical scoping semantics, suitable for configuration values and module-local state that may be reassigned during execution.

**`glob` Keyword**: Explicitly declares global variables with program-wide scope, emphasizing their global nature and intended use for shared state across multiple modules or components.

#### Access Control Modifiers

Jac provides three access control levels for global variables:

- **`:priv`**: Private to the current module, preventing external access
- **`:pub`**: Publicly accessible from other modules and external code
- **`:protect`**: Protected access with limited external visibility

When no access modifier is specified, variables default to module-level visibility with standard scoping rules.

#### Syntax and Usage

```jac
let:priv config_value = "development";
glob:pub shared_counter = 0;
glob:protect system_state = "initialized";
glob default_timeout = 30;
```

#### Integration with Entry Points

Global variables integrate seamlessly with entry blocks and named execution contexts:

```jac
let:priv module_data = initialize_data();
glob:pub api_version = "2.1";

with entry:main {
    print(f"Module data: {module_data}");
    print(f"API Version: {api_version}");
    
    # Global variables remain accessible throughout execution
    process_with_globals();
}
```

#### Common Usage Patterns

**Configuration Management**: Global variables provide centralized configuration storage accessible across the entire program without parameter passing.

**Shared State**: Multiple components can access and modify shared program state through globally accessible variables.

**Module Interfaces**: Public global variables create clean interfaces between modules, exposing necessary data while maintaining encapsulation through access controls.

**System Constants**: Global variables store system-wide constants and settings that remain consistent throughout program execution.

Global variables complement Jac's data spatial programming model by providing persistent state that walkers and other computational entities can access during graph traversal and distributed computation operations.
